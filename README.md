# Welcome to INST 760!

## Indvidual Notebooks

Please configure your indiviual notebook. There is started code available to read in the dataset and clean up the columns. Leave this in place so that we can all be working from the same data and columns. Then do the following: 

1. In the notebooks folder, make a copy of the example notebook. 
2. Change the name to `LastName-Notebook.ipynb`.
3. Add code blocks to compute your visualizations. The notebook format should automatically display them.

## Class Streamlit Dashboard

We will take the best visualizations and together build an interactive dashboard that displays them. This will be available for the world to see. Its already live! Click the button to go to the app. Changes made to the code in this repository will change the app automatically.
